Node JS the complete guide.

## NodeJS
NodeJS is a Javascript on the server, this is possible because NodeJS uses the V8 JavaScript Engine to run all of the JavaScript code that you provide. NodeJS is able to teach Javascript new things by providing C++ bindings to V8, this allows JavaScript in essence, to do anything that C++ can do and C++ can indeed access the file system.
